# FEWD â€“ File Extension WatchDog

Why can't I rename a `.png` file to `.jpg`, and have the computer do the work of converting it for me?
Why do _I_ have to bother with converting files?

**FEWD** comes to the rescue. The File Extension WatchDog silently watches for any file renames,
and (if it can) converts the file automatically.

Simply renaming `photo.png` to `photo.jpg`, and nothing else, will automatically convert the image
properly, behind the scenes, seamlessly.

Here's a [demo video](https://youtu.be/abb6hY2CnCU).

For current issues, check the code; in short, it's (obviously) not perfect.
